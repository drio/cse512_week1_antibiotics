      <p> I am taking the <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">cse512</a>
      from Washington University. The instructor is <a
      href="http://jheer.org/">Jeffrey Heer</a>, a well known contributor in
      the dataviz field.

      <p> In the first week, we had a practical assigment and also a reading
      assigment. See the class <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">site</a>
      for the <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">book</a> reference. I should warn
      you, it is not an easy one to find. Yes, you can get it from <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">Amazon</a> and pay 100$ but I find that a
      bit excessive. You'll have more luck from your local University Library
      (UT in my case). I couldn't take the book home but I was able to make
      digital copies of the first chapter.

      <p> It was a dense but interesting reading. I learnt new terms that will
      help (hopefully) communicate more effectively when talking about dataviz.
      I'll use the book as a reference in the future.

      <p> The practical assigment involves creating a visualization for a
      dataset. A very interesting dataset actually.  Read the assigment details
      <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/a1.html">here</a>.

      <h3>Design's description</h3>
      <p> The first thing you notice as you start playing with the data is the wide range of
      values you can have for the concentrations necessary of each antibiotic to be effective.
      The table does a decent job in communicating the data, but I think my viz requires less
      brain power to process the data and extract the necesary information.

      <p> In this case we want to be able to pick one of the antibiotics, ideally the one that requires
      less concentration so we can save money without compromissing effectiveness. We may not have the
      most efficient antibiotic and we may have to use the second best one.

      <p> I wanted to use distances for my visual encodings since those are processed faster by the
      human brain. But binding mapping the data directly will not work here because of the wide range of
      values in the variables I was refering to above. To solve that, instead of using linear mappings for
      my scales, I use logarithmic scales so we the separation of the values are more meaningful and in turn
      help communicating the data more effectively.
