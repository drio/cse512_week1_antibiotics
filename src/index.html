      <p> I am taking the <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">cse512</a>
      from Washington University. The instructor is <a
      href="http://jheer.org/">Jeffrey Heer</a>, a well known contributor in
      the dataviz field.

      <p> In the first week, we had a practical assigment and also a reading
      assigment. See the class <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">site</a>
      for the <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">book</a> reference. I should warn
      you, it is not an easy one to find. Yes, you can get it from <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">Amazon</a> and pay 100$ but I find that a
      bit excessive. You'll have more luck from your local University Library
      (UT in my case). I couldn't take the book home but I was able to make
      digital copies of the first chapter.

      <p> It was a dense but interesting reading. I learnt new terms that will
      help (hopefully) communicate more effectively when talking about dataviz.
      I'll use the book as a reference in the future.

      <p> The practical assigment involves creating a visualization for a
      dataset. A very interesting dataset actually.  Read the assigment details
